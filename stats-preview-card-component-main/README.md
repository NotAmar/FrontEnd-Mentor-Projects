## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

What i've learned whilst doing this project? This project made me think hard on how to structure things and where to begin. For instance: Mobile first or Desktop first. With this project i started Desktop first, which was a bad idea.

### Continued development

I will try to improve my responsiveness and try to optimize the layout for both Desktop and Mobile.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site helped me with using flex-box.
